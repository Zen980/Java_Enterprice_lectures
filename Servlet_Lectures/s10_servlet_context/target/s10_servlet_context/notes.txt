1.  ServletContext 
    An object of ServletContext is created by the web container when a project is deployed. 
    This object is unique to each web application, meaning there is only one ServletContext object per web application.

2.  Purpose of ServletContext
    The primary purpose of ServletContext is to retrieve configuration information from the web.xml file. 
    It serves as an interface between the container and the servlets. 
    A significant advantage of using ServletContext is its ability to share information across multiple servlets within the same web application.

    Beyond retrieving initialization parameters, the ServletContext object can also be used to set, get, or remove attributes within the application scope. It facilitates inter-application communication.

    Syntax:
        eg.
        <context-param>
            <param-name>community-mail</param-name>
            <param-value>community@example.com</param-value>
        </context-param>
