1.  The <welcome-file-list> is a configuration element defined in the web.xml deployment descriptor

2.  It allows you to specify a list of default files that a web container (like Tomcat or Jetty) should try to serve when a client requests a URL that refers to a directory, rather than a specific file.

3.  Purpose:

    The primary purpose of the <welcome-file-list> is to provide a "default page" for a given directory.
    When a user enters a URL like http://localhost:8080/mywebapp/ (which points to the root of your web application)
    or http://localhost:8080/mywebapp/images/ (which points to a sub-directory),
    the server needs to know what file to display if no specific file is mentioned in the URL.

4.  Syntax:

    <welcome-file-list>
      <welcome-file>default.jsp</welcome-file>
      <welcome-file>index.html</welcome-file>
      <welcome-file>index.htm</welcome-file>
    </welcome-file-list>
