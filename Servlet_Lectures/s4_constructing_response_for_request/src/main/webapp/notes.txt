1.  HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse in Servlets. 
    These two objects are fundamental to how servlets interact with clients (like web browsers). 
    Every time a client sends a request to your web server, the server creates these two objects and passes them to your servlet's doGet(), doPost(), or other doXxx() methods.

2.  HttpServletRequest (The Incoming Request)
    The HttpServletRequest object encapsulates all the information coming from the client to the server. 
    Think of it as a container for everything the client sent. 
    Your servlet uses this object to read what the client wants.

3.  HttpServletResponse (The Outgoing Response)
    The HttpServletResponse object encapsulates all the information that the server sends back to the client. 
    Think of it as a container for what your servlet wants to send back as a reply. 
    Your servlet uses this object to construct the response.
