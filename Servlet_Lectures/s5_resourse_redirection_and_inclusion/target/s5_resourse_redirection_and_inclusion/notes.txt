1. sendRedirect() and RequestDispatcher are used to transfer control from one servlet/JSP to another, 
but they do so in fundamentally different ways, leading to distinct behaviors and use cases.

2. response.sendRedirect() (Client-Side Redirection)
sendRedirect() is a method of the HttpServletResponse object. 
It instructs the client's web browser to send a new, separate request to a different URL. This is a client-side redirection.

The syntax of sendRedirect() is: response.sendRedirect(String url);

The parameter url is the URL to which the client's web browser should be redirected. 
The URL can be absolute or relative, and can include query parameters.

Note: sendRedirect() is a client-side redirection, which means that the client's web browser will issue a new request to the server, 
and the server will respond with a new HTML page. The original request (i.e., the one that caused the redirection) will be terminated.



3. RequestDispatcher (forward() and include()) (Server-Side Dispatching)
RequestDispatcher is an interface that provides methods to forward a request to another resource (like a servlet or JSP) on the same server, or to include the content of another resource into the current response. This is a server-side dispatch.
It is used to transfer control from one servlet to another, without actually creating a new request.

The syntax of RequestDispatcher is:
RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher(String path);

The parameter path is the path to the resource to be included or forwarded. 
It can be absolute or relative, and can include query parameters.

Note: RequestDispatcher is a server-side redirection, which means that the server will process the original request, 
and then forward or include the resource without creating a new request. The original request (i.e., the one that caused the redirection) will not be terminated.

A. requestDispatcher.forward(request, response)
The forward() method transfers control internally on the server from the current servlet/JSP to another resource. 
It is used to forward a request to another resource on the same server, without creating a new request.

B.requestDispatcher.include(request, response)
The include() method allows a servlet or JSP to include the content generated by another resource into its own response. It's like copy-pasting the output of another resource.
