1.  The page directive in JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a fundamental element that provides instructions and information to the JSP container (like Apache Tomcat) about how to process and translate the current JSP page into a Java servlet. It essentially configures the entire JSP page.

2.  Syntax:
        <%@ page attribute="value" attribute="value"... %>

3.  Attributes of JSP page directive
    import - The import attribute is used to import class,interface or all the members of a package.It is similar to import keyword in java class or interface.

    contentType - The contentType attribute defines the MIME(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) type of the HTTP response.The default value is "text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1".

    extends - The extends attribute defines the parent class that will be inherited by the generated servlet.It is rarely used.

    info - This attribute simply sets the information of the JSP page which is retrieved later by using getServletInfo() method of Servlet interface.

    buffer - The buffer attribute sets the buffer size in kilobytes to handle output generated by the JSP page.The default size of the buffer is 8Kb.

    language - The language attribute specifies the scripting language used in the JSP page. The default value is "java".

    isELIgnored - We can ignore the Expression Language (EL) in jsp by the isELIgnored attribute. By default its value is false i.e. Expression Language is enabled by default. We see Expression Language later.
